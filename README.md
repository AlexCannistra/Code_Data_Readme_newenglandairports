# Brief Description
The purpose of this program, the New England Airports Data Explorer,
is supposed to be an interactive web application that enables users
to explore, analyze, and visualize any airport-related data across
the various New England states. With Streamlit integration, this
python program allows users to filter airports by different attributes
such as elevation, runway length, type, and location through  sidebar
controls. This program has several dynamic visualizations, including
bar charts, pie charts, and an interactive heatmap with hoverable
"tooltips" to look into the data in a specific area. Also, it provides
tools for data analysis like pivot tables and top-ranked lists,
giving the user ability to uncover trends, distributions, and regional
patterns in airport info. This application can be used by anyone but is
especially ideal for aviation enthusiasts, researchers, or policymakers
looking to gain insights into airport characteristics and their spatial
distribution across Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire,
Vermont, and Maine.
